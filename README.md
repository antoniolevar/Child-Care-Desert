# Child-Care-Desert
United Way Childcare Deserts Dashboard Project
This project is a data-driven dashboard for the United Way of Rutherford and Cannon Counties (UWRCC) of Tennessee, focused on identifying and visualizing the availability of childcare resources in Rutherford and Cannon counties. The dashboard aims to highlight "childcare deserts," areas where demand for childcare services exceeds local capacity, helping UWRCC advocate for solutions with municipal governments, employers, and childcare providers.

Project Purpose
UWRCC's mission is to support community health, education, and financial stability. Access to affordable childcare is critical for local economic health and individual opportunity, and this dashboard provides an evidence-backed visualization of childcare deserts, identifying the gaps in childcare availability across regions. This analysis supports UWRCC's mission to ensure equitable access to resources for all families.
